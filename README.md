# pi-cli
A small command-line-based programm that tries to calculate pi

The binary is for Linux, however the source should work on Windows aswell.

I'm not trying to be efficient, professional or anything like that, this is just for practice.
However you are welcome to write feedback. (If anyone ever finds this for some reason...)
**If you actually want a decent program that calculates pi or really any math constant, you should check out Y-Cruncher http://www.numberworld.org/y-cruncher/**
